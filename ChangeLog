Version 0.5.1 (2010/06)
* changed hook calls to eleminate error "Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated"

Version 0.5.0 (2010/06)
* added hooks
* added browsers: Chrome, IE 9, iPad, iPhone
* added os: Windows 7
* added search engine: search.ch

Version 0.4.0 (2010/05)
* Removed generic browser identification strings from list of browsers. That means a user agent identifying itself as “Mozilla/5.0” (or 4.0 or 3.0) will now be counted as robot, not as a human visitor. This fix leads to more exact numbers of visitors. But it also changes the behaviour of ke_stats. Please notice that numbers from before and and after version 0.4.0 are not directly comparable. You may compare them if you substract the numbers of “Mozilla 5 compatible”, “Mozilla 4 compatible” and “Mozilla 3 compatible” in the “browsers” section from the pageviews in versions below 0.4.0.
* new feature: log file writing (can be activated in extension manager). Mainly for debugging purposes.
* added some new robots.
* Integrated french translation, thanks to Nicolas Liaudat.

Version 0.3.1 (2009/10)
* bugfix: ipfilter feature was accidently dropped in 0.3.0

Version 0.3.0 (2009/10)
* little bugfix: fixed path to flotr lib, thanks to Christoph Werner 
* new feature: ignoreRobots. May be set in extension manager. Ignores Robots and saves database space.
* performance optimization: getOldestQueueEntry is a lot faster now (used in asynchronous data refreshing).
* optimization: slightly improved layout (css) for result tables in backend module.
* added some new robots.
* optimization: added check for valid entries in cli script.
* important bugfix: Treat unknown user agents as robots. Otherwise all pageviews from unknown user agents are counted as pageviews from human visitors, which is not true and gives false results. The number of false counts is identical to the number of entries titled "unknown" in the "browsers" table. By subtracting this number from your pageviews number, you have the correct number of pageviews.
* New robot (google search appliance).
* little bugfix: changed ext_tables.sql so that extension manager does not want to change database all the time …
* removed time information in overview page (makes no sense here since it is no updated asynchronously).
* little change in debugEmail: don't send E-Mail if no recipient is given.

* corrected db-calls, using TYPO3_DB::fullQuoteString in Backend Module now, thanks to Pierrick Caillon.

* new search engines and robots.
* Backend module: Tab “Live Tracking” is now hidden if tracking is disabled.
* Bugfix: Statistic was not disabled for backend users visiting frontend pages. Now nothing is counted if a backend user is logged in. Configurable in the extension manager (ignoreBackendUsers).

Version 0.1.9 (2008/08)
* fixed bug: Searchwords from google searches are counted correctly now. 

Version 0.1.8 (2008/08)

Version 0.1.4 (2008/06)

* Pagetype and language appear in the detailled list. 
* Bug fixed: Dropdown menus for type and language did not function properly.
* Results may now be filtered by selecting a page in the pagetree. Because of this new feature, you won't see any  statistical data from the past anymore when you update from version 0.0.1. Exception is the “page” statistic, which remains intact. Unfortunately, this new feature will also blow up the necessary database space. The table should be observed if it grows way too big on heavy load websites.
* added database index for speed optimization.
* changed status to beta.

Version 0.0.1 (2007/05)
* initial uploadFor Changelog see manual in doc/ directory.
